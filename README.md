Introduction
------------

`choose` is a small package for the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) that produces all combinations of *M* out of *N* items.  The core part of the code is based on [Matthew Belmonte's C implementation](http://www.netlib.org/toms-2014-06-10/382) of Phillip J. Chase's [Algorithm 382: Combinations of *M* out of *N* Objects](https://doi.org/10.1145/362384.362502).

Installation
------------

The `choose` package has opted into the [Go module system](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) so installation is in fact unnecessary if your program or package has done likewise.  Otherwise, a traditional
```bash
go get github.com/spakin/choose
```
will install the package.

Documentation
-------------

See the [`choose` API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spakin/choose?tab=doc) for details, but the basic usage model is to invoke a function that accepts a slice and returns a channel, then iterate over that channel's contents, each of which is a slice of the same type as the input.
